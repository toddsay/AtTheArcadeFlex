At-The-Arcade Flex (layout for Attract-Mode front end)
------------------------------------------------------
This layout theoretically supports all resolutions and aspect ratios, but only the common ones have been tested,
and it is possible that some features or settings combinations have not been adequately tested. Please use the
Attract-Mode forums and let me know if you encounter problems.

Instructions:

Short version for users who know Attract-Mode:
----------------------------------------------

Copy the contents of the "At-The-Arcade Flex Master" to your AttractMode folder

Specifically:
1. Copy the 'layouts/At-The-Arcade Flex' folder to your attract layouts folder 
2. If you don't already have it, copy the 'gtc-common' folder to your main attract folder (where the attract.exe file is)
3. If you don't already have it, copy the 'gtc', 'gtc-kb' and 'gtc-pas' folders from the included modules folder to your attract\modules folder
4. Download all the relevant art from here: http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?topic=3979.0
5. Extract the cabinets art to your 'attract/menu-art/mame/cabinets' folder
6. Launch attract mode and assign the 'At-The-Arcade Flex' theme (layout) that you want to your mame emulator

---------------------------------------------


Detailed version:

Stage 1: Prepare the games roms and media for the emulated system
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Download all the game roms and media and place them in folders of your choosing.
Download all the relevant art from here: http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?topic=3979.0
For example, for MAME, place the roms in  'C:\attract\systems\mame\roms'

You can download all the media you need from emumovies.com (wheel logos, snaps (game videos), cart art, box art, marquees, bezels, flyers, fanart, etc)
In attract mode's 'menu-art' folder, create a folder for your system, example:
'C:\attract\menu-art\mame'

In this folder create the following folders:
C:\attract\menu-art\mame\wheel
C:\attract\menu-art\mame\snap
C:\attract\menu-art\mame\boxart
C:\attract\menu-art\mame\cartart
C:\attract\menu-art\mame\marquee
C:\attract\menu-art\mame\bezels
C:\attract\menu-art\mame\flyer
C:\attract\menu-art\mame\fanart
C:\attract\menu-art\mame\cabinets

Copy the relevant files to each folder (wheel logos to 'wheel', snap videos to 'snap', cabinets, to 'cabinets', etc).

Now you need to connect the emulator to the media. For each system attract mode has an emulator cfg file located in ...\attract\emulators

In our example it will be: C:\attract\emulators\mame.cfg
You can edit this file with notepad or from within attract mode's menu system. Here you will tell attract mode what emulator to use, where to find all the art, etc.

It should look something like this:

# Generated by Attract-Mode v2.6.1
#
executable           C:/attract/systems/mame/mame64.exe
args                 [name]
rompath              C:/attract/systems/mame/roms
romext               .zip;.chd
system               Arcade
info_source          listxml
exit_hotkey          Escape
artwork    wheel           C:/attract/menu-art/mame/wheel
artwork    snap            C:/attract/menu-art/mame/snap
artwork    boxart          C:/attract/menu-art/mame/boxart
artwork    cartart         C:/attract/menu-art/mame/cartart
artwork    marquee         C:/attract/menu-art/mame/marquee
artwork    bezels          C:/attract/menu-art/mame/bezels
artwork    flyer           C:/attract/menu-art/mame/flyer
artwork    fanart          C:/attract/menu-art/mame/fanart
artwork    cabinets        C:/attract/menu-art/mame/cabinets

[optionally, if using pinball, specify a "pincabs" location]
artwork    pincabs         C:/attract/menu-art/Pinball FX3/cabinet


As you can see, the "artwork" label tells attract mode to find wheel in 'C:/attract/menu-art/mame/wheel', snap (videos) in 'C:/attract/menu-art/mame/snap' 
cabinets in 'C:/attract/menu-art/mame/cabinets' etc.

Replace the paths in the example to the ones you have, save and close the file.


Stage 2: Set up the layout as your themes of choice
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Copy the 'At-The-Arcade Flex' folder to your attract layouts folder 
2. If you don't already have it, copy the 'gtc-common' folder to your main attract folder (where the attract.exe file is)
3. If you don't already have it, copy the 'gtc', 'gtc-kb' and 'gtc-pas' folders from the included modules folder to your attract\modules folder
4. Launch attract mode and assign the 'At-The-Arcade Flex' theme (layout) to your mame emulator.
Pressing 'Tab' will bring the main 'Configure' menu on screen. Then go to 'Displays', choose the display you want to configure by
pressing 'Enter' and choose a layout from the 'Layout' option (navigate the layouts list with up/down arrows or joystick).

Attract Mode should now know what emulator to use, where to find the art it needs and what theme to use.

Make sure to check out all the layout options as you can heavily customize it. 
To do so, Press "Tab->Displays->Layout Options" or assign a hotkey by pressing "Tab->Controls->Layout Options->Add Input"


Music
-----
You can add mp3 music files to the layout's music folder that is within the At-The-Arcade MultiCab folder or to an external music folder of your choosing.
The layout will play them each time it loads when "Enable ambience sound" option is set to "Music".
You can define a path to an external music folder and assign keys to play next or previous song through the layout options menu.


Performance
-----------
If performance on low end systems such as the Raspberry Pi is slow, you can improve it by disabling shader related options in the layout options menu:
- Set "Enable CRT screen glow" to "No" 
- Set "Enable lighted marquee effect" to "No"
- Set "Select background image" to "Retro"
- Set "Enable wheel background" to "No"
- Try a landscape/horizontal screen orientation (not portrait/vertical)
